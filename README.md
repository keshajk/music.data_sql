MySQL with a music database
---------------------------
This example SQL project was created to practice writing SQL queries for a job interview. I hope others will find it useful. The data is simple and the listing of record labels, albums, artists and songs is just for example purposes. You can try altering the tables to make them more complete and more interesting.

Prerequisites
-------------
(i)  Install mysql
(ii) A SQL editing environment such as: SQuirreL SQL Client or IntelliJ IDE or the MySQL Workbench

Having difficulty in downloading MYSQL Workbench??
Find my repository for detailed step-by-step procedure.
